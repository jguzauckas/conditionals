# This file has some sample conditionals for you to build and utilize

# Make a dictionary whose keys are your favorite hobbies, and values
# are one thing you like about the hobby. Try to have at least three
# key-value pairs!


# Use conditionals to check if one hobby you didn't choose exists as
# a key in the dictionary, and one hobby you did choose, making a
# statement about each. If neither, make a statement about how their
# hobbies are unique.


# Make a variable where the user enters their grade level as an integer:


# Make a statement about each of the high school grades (i.e. 9 would
# say "You are a freshman"), and otherwise say "Your grade isn't in
# high school!"


# Make a set out of the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"


# Check for the absence of three different letters (you choose) in the set.
# If a letter is missing, make a statement about it. If none of the letters
# you choose are missing, say "You have a lot of different letters!"
