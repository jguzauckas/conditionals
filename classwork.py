# This file has some sample conditionals for you to build and utilize

# Make a variable that asks the user for their name:


# Make a conditional that greets the person with a special greeting
# if their name matches a certain string (could be your name!) and
# gives them a standard greeting otherwise.


# Make a variable of a tuple of your 3 favorite teachers


# Make a conditional that checks if "Guzauckas" is in the tuple,
# and says "Great Choice" if it is. Then check if "Lorenzet" is
# in the tuple, and say "Lorenzet is also a great choice", and
# then say "You could have made better choices" if neither are in
# the tuple.


# Make a double variable that asks the user for their grade in
# this class as a double (0 for 0%, 0.5 for 50%, 1 for 100%, etc.).


# Then, print the user's letter grade based on their entered
# numerical grade (A, B, C, D, or F, don't worry about +/-)


# Make a variable of a list with your top 4 classes this year
# (in order! The first slot should be your favorite class)


# Make a conditional that looks for our class (AP CS Principles)
# in each slot of the list and make a statement regarding which
# place it got. (i.e., "First place, awesome!", "Second place is
# alright", etc. and "Oh no! We didn't make the list" if it is
# not in the list)
